## 1) Introduction of PostgreSQL
- PostgreSQL is an ORDBMS [`Open-Source Object-Relational Database Management System`]. It is used to store data securely; supporting best practices, and allow recovering them when the request is processed.
- PostgreSQL is initially introduced on 8th July 1996 at the University of California.
- It is the first DBMS, which perform MVCC [Multi-Version Concurrency Control] feature.
- It is written in C programming language.
- PostgreSQL is cross-platform and runs on various operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, UNIX, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, HP-UX, LINUX, and so on.
- PostgreSQL is also pronounced as Post-gress-Q-L, which is developed by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group (a worldwide team of volunteers), any organization or other private entity does not control it.
- PostgreSQL will offer us the facility to add custom functions with the help of various programming languages such as Java, C, and C++, etc. In this, we can describe our functional languages, index types and data types, and we can also create a custom plugin to increase the reliability of our needs.
- The PostgreSQL follow the transaction along with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties.

## 2) Feature of PostgreSQL
- Free to download
- Compatible on several `Operation Systems`
- Compatible with various `Programming Languages`
- It supports `Data Integrity` which includes the following:
    - Primary Keys
    - UNIQUE, NOT NULL
    - Foreign Keys
    - Explicit Locks, Advisory Locks
    - Exclusion Constraints
- It supports various `Features of SQL` which include the followings:
    - MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control).
    - Multiple Indexing such as Multicolumn, Partial, B-tree, and expressions.
    - SQL sub-selects.
    - Complex SQL queries.
    - Streaming Replication
    - Transactions, Nested Transactions through Savepoints.
    - Just-in-time compilation of expressions
    - Table partitioning
- It support various `Data Types` such as:
    - Structured: Array, Date and Time, UUID (Universally Unique Identifier), Range.
    - Primitives: String, Integer, Boolean, Numeric.
    - Customizations: Custom Types, Composite.
    - Geometry: Polygon, Circle, Line, Point,
    - Document: XML, JSON/JSONB, Key-value.
- It is `Highly Extensible` in several phases which are as following:
    - It supports procedural Languages such as Perl, PL/PGSQL, and Python, etc.
    - JSON/SQL path expressions
    - Stored procedures and functions.
    - For tables, it supports a customizable storage interface.
    - It is compatible with foreign data wrappers, which connect to further databases with a standard SQL interface.
- It is safe because it follows several `Security` aspects, which are as follows:
    - PostgreSQL provides a robust access control system.
    - It includes several Authentications such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol(LDAP), Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI), SCRAM-SHA-256, Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI), Certificate, and so on.
    - PostgreSQL supports Column and row-level security.
- It is `Highly Reliable` and also provide disaster recovery such as:
    - Active standbys, PITR (Point in time recovery)
    - It supports WAL (Write-ahead Logging)
    - Tablespaces
    - It supports different types of Replication like Synchronous, Asynchronous, and Logical.
- It supports `Internationalization`, which means that the international character sets include ICU collations, accent-insensitive and case-sensitive collations, and full-text searches.
- In PostgreSQL, a table can be set to `inherit` their characteristics from a "parent" table.
- It is compatible with `ANSI-SQL2008`.
- PostgreSQL will help us to improve the functionality of `Server-Side programming`.
- We can install several `extensions` to add additional functionality to PostgreSQL.

## 3) Advantages and Disadvantages of PostgreSQL
- Advantages:
    - PostgreSQL is easy to use; that why we do not require much training.
    - It requires low maintenance management for enterprise as well as embedded usage.
    - PostgreSQL manages data in a relational database as it is very powerful and robust.
    - We can quickly get the source code of PostgreSQL as it is freely available in an open-source license, and we can immediately implement, change according to our requirements.
    - It can execute dynamic web-application and website as the LAMP stack option.
    - PostgreSQL is a highly risk-tolerant database.

- Disadvantages:
    - PostgreSQL does not support the various open-source applications as compared to MySQL.
    - In this, creating replication is a bit complex.
    - It is not maintained by one company.
    - PostgreSQL speed performance is not as good as compare to further tools.
    - It is a bit slow as compared to MySQL.
    - Sometimes, the installation process is not easy for the learner.

## 4) Download and Install PostgreSQL
- To download PostgreSQL, Go to the Official website (https://www.postgresql.org/) of PostgreSQL and download setup as per OS.
- Note that during installation, it will ask for password to set which will required everytime when accessing database.

## 5) Connect to a PostgreSQL Database Server
- We can connect the PostgreSQL database server using:
    - `pgAdmin 4`: It is an in-built Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    - `SQL Shell (PSQL)`: It is a terminal-based front-end application.
- Default configuration will be:
    - `Host Server`: localhost
    - `Database`: postgres
    - `Port`: 5432
    - `Username`: postgres
    - `Password`: [which created during installation]
- Note that while writing a command in `SQL Shell (PSQL)`, we should make sure that the specified command would end with a `Semicolon (;)`.

## 6) SQL Shell (PSQL) commands list
- `Connect to a database` - Same host database:
```
psql -d <db-name> -U <username> -W

// -W - forces psql to ask for the user password before connecting to the database
``` 
- `Connect to a database` - Different host database:
```
psql -h <db-address> -d <db-name> -U <username> -W
```
- `Connect to a database` - Different host database with SSL mode:
```
psql "sslmode=require host=<db-address> dbname=<db-name> user=<username>"
```
- `List all databases`: Return with all databases and their name, owner, encoding, access privileges, and other information
```
\l
```
- `Switch to another database`:
```
\c <db-name>
```
- `List database tables`: Return with table's schema, name, type, owner 
```
\dt
```
- `Describe a table`: 
```
\d <table-name>

// Returns all the columns, their types, collection, whether they are nullable or not, and their configured default value.
```
```
\d+ <table-name>

// Returns extra information such as storage, compression, stats target, and a description.
```
- `List all schemas`: Returns the name of the schemas and their owners.
```
\dn
```
- `List users and their roles`:
```
\du
```
- `Retrieve a specific user`:
```

```
- `List all functions`: Rreturns all functions and schema they belong to, names, result data type, argument data types, type
```
\df
```
- `List all views`:
```
\dv

```
- `Save the command history to a file`:
```
\s <file-name>
```
- `Save query results to a file`:
```
\o <file-name>

// To stop saving results to the file, you need to run the [\o] command again without the file name.
```
- `Run commands from a file`: 
    - Create a txt file with the following content:
    ```
    \l
    \dt
    \du
    ```
    - Now run following command to run above command from file:
    ```
    \i <file-name>
    ```
- `Know all available psql commands`:
```
\?
```
- `Get help`:
```

```
\H
```
- `Quit psql`:
```
\q
```

## 7) Create Database using pgAdmin 4
- Open pgAdmin 4 -> Servers -> PostgreSQL 15 -> Databases -> right click on it and enter DB info in create database window.
- Syntax to create a database:
```
CREATE DATABASE database_name
    WITH
        [OWNER =  role_name]
        [TEMPLATE = template]
        [ENCODING = encoding]
        [LC_COLLATE = collate]
        [LC_CTYPE = ctype]
        [TABLESPACE = tablespace_name]
        [ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = true | false]
        [CONNECTION LIMIT = max_concurrent_connection]
        [IS_TEMPLATE = true | false ]
```
- Parameters:
    - `OWNER`: Assign a role that will be the owner of the database. If you omit the OWNER option, the owner of the database is the role that you use to execute the CREATE DATABASE statement.
    - `TEMPLATE`: Specify the template database from which the new database is created. By default, PostgreSQL uses the template1 database as the template database if you donâ€™t explicitly specify the template database.
    - `ENCODING`: Determine the character set encoding in the new database.
    - `LC_COLLATE`: Specify the collation order (LC_COLLATE) that the new database will use. This parameter affects the sort order of string in the queries that contain the ORDER BY clause. It defaults to the LC_COLLATE of the template database.
    - `LC_CTYPE`: Specify the character classification that the new database will use. It affects the classification of character e.g., lower, upper, and digit. It defaults to the LC_CTYPE of the template database
    - `TABLESPACE`: Specify the tablespace name for the new database. The default is the tablespace of the template database.
    - `CONNECTION LIMIT`: Specify the maximum concurrent connections to the new database. The default is -1 i.e., unlimited. This parameter is useful in the shared hosting environments where you can configure the maximum concurrent connections for a particular database.
    - `ALLOW_CONNECTIONS`: The allow_connections parameter is a boolean value. If it is false, you cannot connect to the database.
    - `TABLESPACE`: Specify the tablespace that the new database will use. It defaults to the tablespace of the template database.
    - `IS_TEMPLATE`: If the IS_TEMPLATE is true, any user with the CREATEDB privilege can clone it. If false, only superusers or the database owner can clone it.

- Example:
```
CREATE DATABASE blog
    WITH
    OWNER = postgres
    ENCODING = 'UTF8'
    LC_COLLATE = 'English_United States.1252'
    LC_CTYPE = 'English_United States.1252'
    TABLESPACE = pg_default
    CONNECTION LIMIT = -1
    IS_TEMPLATE = False;

COMMENT ON DATABASE blog
    IS 'Test comment';
```

## 8) Create Database Command Line (SQL Shell)
- Open the SQL shell and Connect with server by using default configuration (To use default config, just enter without writing anything except for password)
- Now run following command to create database with default configuration:
```
CREATE DATABASE blog;
```

## 9) Delete/Drop Database
- Using pgAdmin 4, right click on database and click on `Delete/Drop Database`
- Using SQL Shell, run below command:
```
DROP DATABASE [ IF EXISTS] database_name;
```
- Note that using SQL Shell, we need to first select different/default database to delete/drop our database.

## 10) Alter Database
- Changing attributes of a database
```
ALTER DATABASE database_name [ [WITH] option ]

//where option can be:
    ALLOW_CONNECTIONS allowconn
    CONNECTION LIMIT connlimit
    IS_TEMPLATE istemplate
```
- Rename the database
```
ALTER DATABASE database_name
RENAME TO new_name;
```
- Change the owner of the database
```
ALTER DATABASE database_name
OWNER TO new_owner | current_user | session_user;
```
